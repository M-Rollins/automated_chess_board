Command format: [cmd type][arg1] [arg2];
	-command type is a single character
	-arguments are positive integers, separated by spaces (a space is necessary to separate multiple numerical arguments. All other spaces are ignored)
	-A semicolon marks the end of a command


H: home x and y axes
X[coord]: go to x position
Y[coord]: go to y position
M[x1][y1][x2][y2]: move from one square to another with the magnet on (e.g. M00 00 01 01)
	-(0, 0) is the bottom-right-most usable location
	-(14, 9) is the top-right limit
	-(4, 1) is a1
P[move]: play move, given in long algebraic notation (e.g. Pe2e4)
A: fix piece alignment (go to every occupied square and briefly power the magnet)
I: initialize board state (without moving pieces)
	I00: empty position (all pieces stowed on the sides)
	I01: starting position
B: print board state

*not implemented*
L: report bounds (steps and squares)
S: set up board (move pieces into position)
	S00: empty position
	S01: starting position
